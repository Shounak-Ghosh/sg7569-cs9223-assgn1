# CODEOWNERS
# This file assigns code ownership for the repository. When changes are made
# to files matching a pattern, the listed owners are automatically requested
# for review. For this assignment we set the repository owner as the owner
# for all files.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
